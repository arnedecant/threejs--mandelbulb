            This app uses your camera to visualize the video stream on a particle system. Each particle is animated according to the color of that particular pixel on your webcam and the song being played. This means this app needs both your permission to capture your camera and play music.

            Some browsers require user interaction before any audio can be played. By clicking "okay" this app has the necessary user interaction to play music.

            As with most of my web experiments, use Google Chrome for an optimal user experience.
